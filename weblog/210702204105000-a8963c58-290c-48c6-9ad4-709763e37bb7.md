  <h1>Interesting Ruby to Native Code</h1>

  <p><a href="/posts/tag?id=ruby/">#ruby</a> <a href="/posts/tag?id=crystal/">#crystal</a> <a href="/posts/tag?id=native_ruby/">#native ruby</a></p>

  <p>Hmm I wonder which rock has I&#39;ve been under that I will need a friend to point me to <a href="https://crystal-lang.org/" title="Crystal lang">Crystal lang</a></p>

  <p><img src="/uploads/crystallang.png" alt="images"></p>

  <p>It was created in year 2014 and got into version 1.0.0 on 22nd March 2021 [Wiki entry]<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_(programming_language)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_(programming_language)</a></p>

  <p>The syntax is so similar with Ruby that I think direct 1 to 1 conversion from Ruby to Crystal is possible since the creator loves the Ruby so much that it is publicly declared <a href="https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal">Crystal lang GitHub</a></p>

  <p>Crystal compiles Ruby code into native code which tremendously increase the speed of the execution of the code, which save the need to create C plugin using FFI or the like. </p>

  <p>It also possible to compile Crystal down to shared or static library as this heroic <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/32921404">StackOverflow post</a> shows and <a href="https://gist.github.com/Papierkorb/02d6ba53c28b5035a80bf7695f4706bb">here</a></p>
